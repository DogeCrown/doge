This repository was created with the intention of instituting a hard fork of the Dogecoin Core application.

The fork will re-appropriate dogecoin mined as empty blocks from the miner addresses to the following address: "[to be written when implemented]".
The fork will preserve most other coin ownership at the existing addresses recorded on the Dogecoin blockchain
The fork will rebrand the "dog" meme to make the coin friendlier for international use and more respectable.
The fork will limit empty block mining by creating a delay of 55 seconds for the acceptance of empty blocks.
The fork will reduce the block reward to 1000, and will reduce the block reward by 100 coins every 6 months, until it reaches a minimum of 100 coins.

Doge is a community-driven cryptocurrency that was forked from the Dogecoin project and rebranded for use as an international currency. The Doge Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Doge blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Bitcoin Core and other cryptocurrencies.


[[editing required for rebranding]]
For information about the default fees used on the Doge network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

## Usage üíª

To start your journey with Dogecoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Dogecoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `dogecoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `dogecoin-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Such ports

Dogecoin Core by default uses port `22556` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `22555` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   22556 |   44556 |   18444 |
| RPC      |   22555 |   44555 |   18332 |
